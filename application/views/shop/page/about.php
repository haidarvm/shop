  		<div class="twelve columns">
            <p>Back to the basics, the dictum of  the analog phase. True handmade, authentic, ridged, human touch perfection with beautiful imperfections; that is Jackston. Retro, old but cool. What is ever old skool, is never old fashioned. From forgotten finds uncovered in thrifty stores, pictures of  a road trip taken long ago, the feel of  the decay, the texture of  the paper, the smell of  the moist & dust. That is real, that is value. The yearning for something new. We translate inspiration from the past into tangible designs that are relatable today.</p>
            <p>Therefore we make modern, everyday, comfortable clothing by combining traditional techniques, innovation & modern design. For the feel, the comfort, the rough natural hand work of  traditional prints to burnt engraved insignia combined with precision stitching; all this has been our ambition to make clothes as well as possible & offer true value.</p>
            <p>Our family of  products are designed to give folks the opportunity to show off  their individuality, attitude, style with a statement. In the monotony of  a weekly wardrobe we hope to give people something different. So join the clan, the Jackston clan.</p>
